# Define Models

#
# Seq2Seq Model
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# The brains of our chatbot is a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model. The
# goal of a seq2seq model is to take a variable-length sequence as an
# input, and return a variable-length sequence as an output using a
# fixed-sized model.
#
# `Sutskever et al. <https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215>`__ discovered that
# by using two separate recurrent neural nets together, we can accomplish
# this task. One RNN acts as an **encoder**, which encodes a variable
# length input sequence to a fixed-length context vector. In theory, this
# context vector (the final hidden layer of the RNN) will contain semantic
# information about the query sentence that is input to the bot. The
# second RNN is a **decoder**, which takes an input word and the context
# vector, and returns a guess for the next word in the sequence and a
# hidden state to use in the next iteration.

# Encoder
# ~~~~~~~
#
# The encoder RNN iterates through the input sentence one token
# (e.g. word) at a time, at each time step outputting an “output” vector
# and a “hidden state” vector. The hidden state vector is then passed to
# the next time step, while the output vector is recorded. The encoder
# transforms the context it saw at each point in the sequence into a set
# of points in a high-dimensional space, which the decoder will use to
# generate a meaningful output for the given task.
#
# At the heart of our encoder is a multi-layered Gated Recurrent Unit,
# invented by `Cho et al. <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.1078v3.pdf>`__ in
# 2014. We will use a bidirectional variant of the GRU, meaning that there
# are essentially two independent RNNs: one that is fed the input sequence
# in normal sequential order, and one that is fed the input sequence in
# reverse order. The outputs of each network are summed at each time step.
# Using a bidirectional GRU will give us the advantage of encoding both
# past and future contexts.
#
# Bidirectional RNN:

#    :alt: rnn_bidir
#
# Image source: https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-NN-Types-FP/
#
# Note that an ``embedding`` layer is used to encode our word indices in
# an arbitrarily sized feature space. For our models, this layer will map
# each word to a feature space of size *hidden_size*. When trained, these
# values should encode semantic similarity between similar meaning words.
#
# Finally, if passing a padded batch of sequences to an RNN module, we
# must pack and unpack padding around the RNN pass using
# ``nn.utils.rnn.pack_padded_sequence`` and
# ``nn.utils.rnn.pad_packed_sequence`` respectively.
#
# **Computation Graph:**
#
#    1) Convert word indexes to embeddings.
#    2) Pack padded batch of sequences for RNN module.
#    3) Forward pass through GRU.
#    4) Unpack padding.
#    5) Sum bidirectional GRU outputs.
#    6) Return output and final hidden state.
#
# **Inputs:**
#
# -  ``input_seq``: batch of input sentences; shape=\ *(max_length,
#    batch_size)*
# -  ``input_lengths``: list of sentence lengths corresponding to each
#    sentence in the batch; shape=\ *(batch_size)*
# -  ``hidden``: hidden state; shape=\ *(n_layers x num_directions,
#    batch_size, hidden_size)*
#
# **Outputs:**
#
# -  ``outputs``: output features from the last hidden layer of the GRU
#    (sum of bidirectional outputs); shape=\ *(max_length, batch_size,
#    hidden_size)*
# -  ``hidden``: updated hidden state from GRU; shape=\ *(n_layers x
#    num_directions, batch_size, hidden_size)*

######################################################################
# Decoder
# ~~~~~~~
#
# The decoder RNN generates the response sentence in a token-by-token
# fashion. It uses the encoder’s context vectors, and internal hidden
# states to generate the next word in the sequence. It continues
# generating words until it outputs an *EOS_token*, representing the end
# of the sentence. A common problem with a vanilla seq2seq decoder is that
# if we rely solely on the context vector to encode the entire input
# sequence’s meaning, it is likely that we will have information loss.
# This is especially the case when dealing with long input sequences,
# greatly limiting the capability of our decoder.
#
# To combat this, `Bahdanau et al. <https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473>`__
# created an “attention mechanism” that allows the decoder to pay
# attention to certain parts of the input sequence, rather than using the
# entire fixed context at every step.
#
# At a high level, attention is calculated using the decoder’s current
# hidden state and the encoder’s outputs. The output attention weights
# have the same shape as the input sequence, allowing us to multiply them
# by the encoder outputs, giving us a weighted sum which indicates the
# parts of encoder output to pay attention to. `Sean
# Robertson’s <https://github.com/spro>`__ figure describes this very
# well:
#
# .. figure:: /_static/img/chatbot/attn2.png
#    :align: center
#    :alt: attn2
#
# `Luong et al. <https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04025>`__ improved upon
# Bahdanau et al.’s groundwork by creating “Global attention”. The key
# difference is that with “Global attention”, we consider all of the
# encoder’s hidden states, as opposed to Bahdanau et al.’s “Local
# attention”, which only considers the encoder’s hidden state from the
# current time step. Another difference is that with “Global attention”,
# we calculate attention weights, or energies, using the hidden state of
# the decoder from the current time step only. Bahdanau et al.’s attention
# calculation requires knowledge of the decoder’s state from the previous
# time step. Also, Luong et al. provides various methods to calculate the
# attention energies between the encoder output and decoder output which
# are called “score functions”:
#
# .. figure:: /_static/img/chatbot/scores.png
#    :width: 60%
#    :align: center
#    :alt: scores
#
# where :math:`h_t` = current target decoder state and :math:`\bar{h}_s` =
# all encoder states.
#
# Overall, the Global attention mechanism can be summarized by the
# following figure. Note that we will implement the “Attention Layer” as a
# separate ``nn.Module`` called ``Attn``. The output of this module is a
# softmax normalized weights tensor of shape *(batch_size, 1,
# max_length)*.

# -------------------------
#
# Masked loss
# ~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Since we are dealing with batches of padded sequences, we cannot simply
# consider all elements of the tensor when calculating loss. We define
# ``maskNLLLoss`` to calculate our loss based on our decoder’s output
# tensor, the target tensor, and a binary mask tensor describing the
# padding of the target tensor. This loss function calculates the average
# negative log likelihood of the elements that correspond to a *1* in the
# mask tensor.
#

# Single training iteration
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# The ``train`` function contains the algorithm for a single training
# iteration (a single batch of inputs).
#
# We will use a couple of clever tricks to aid in convergence:
#
# -  The first trick is using **teacher forcing**. This means that at some
#    probability, set by ``teacher_forcing_ratio``, we use the current
#    target word as the decoder’s next input rather than using the
#    decoder’s current guess. This technique acts as training wheels for
#    the decoder, aiding in more efficient training. However, teacher
#    forcing can lead to model instability during inference, as the
#    decoder may not have a sufficient chance to truly craft its own
#    output sequences during training. Thus, we must be mindful of how we
#    are setting the ``teacher_forcing_ratio``, and not be fooled by fast
#    convergence.
#
# -  The second trick that we implement is **gradient clipping**. This is
#    a commonly used technique for countering the “exploding gradient”
#    problem. In essence, by clipping or thresholding gradients to a
#    maximum value, we prevent the gradients from growing exponentially
#    and either overflow (NaN), or overshoot steep cliffs in the cost
#    function.

#    :alt: grad_clip
#
# Image source: Goodfellow et al. *Deep Learning*. 2016. https://www.deeplearningbook.org/
#
# **Sequence of Operations:**
#
#    1) Forward pass entire input batch through encoder.
#    2) Initialize decoder inputs as SOS_token, and hidden state as the encoder's final hidden state.
#    3) Forward input batch sequence through decoder one time step at a time.
#    4) If teacher forcing: set next decoder input as the current target; else: set next decoder input as current decoder output.
#    5) Calculate and accumulate loss.
#    6) Perform backpropagation.
#    7) Clip gradients.
#    8) Update encoder and decoder model parameters.
#
#
# .. Note ::
#
#   PyTorch’s RNN modules (``RNN``, ``LSTM``, ``GRU``) can be used like any
#   other non-recurrent layers by simply passing them the entire input
#   sequence (or batch of sequences). We use the ``GRU`` layer like this in
#   the ``encoder``. The reality is that under the hood, there is an
#   iterative process looping over each time step calculating hidden states.
#   Alternatively, you can run these modules one time-step at a time. In
#   this case, we manually loop over the sequences during the training
#   process like we must do for the ``decoder`` model. As long as you
#   maintain the correct conceptual model of these modules, implementing
#   sequential models can be very straightforward.
